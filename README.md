# My Fitbit
### Overview

The code is broken into two R scripts. <a href='https://github.com/jlweichen/myFitbit/blob/master/regressionfitbitdata.r'> Regressionfitbitdata.R</a> is primarily for communication with the Fitbit API, returning data, and cleaning it to create a data table. The second script <a href='https://github.com/jlweichen/myFitbit/blob/master/regressionoffitbit.r'>regressionoffitbit.R</a>, reads the data and creates a regression model to predict the amount of calories burnt in a day's activities.
